Behavioural measures
As we had hypothesized (H1), there was a significant main effect of context on (log) response times of the first phase (choices), with shorter times for the low-volatility condition (_RT_context_; Figure 2A, B). The interaction group x context was also significant (_RT_groupxcontext_). Response times showed a dependence on the later amount offered and whether the response was immediate or delayed, but the effect of context remained significant even when controlling for these effects (_RTamountchoice_context). There was a main effect of context on choices (_choice_context_; Figure 2C, D), with a lower probability of choosing the later option in the low volatility context, but the interaction with the later amount offered was not significant (_choice_contextxamount_). Thus, even though the context affected response probabilities, preregistered hypothesis H2 was not confirmed.

DDM parameters
The DDM parameters were rather stable across contexts (Figure 3A, B). We found an effect of context on non-decision times derived from the DDM fits, with slower times for the low-volatility context, confirming hypothesis H3 (_nondectime.p_context_). Drift sensitivity was significantly higher in the low-volatility context (_b.drift.amount.p_context), thus supporting hypothesis H4. In the low-volatility context, the noise parameter was significantly larger (_noise.p_context_) and the bias smaller (_bias.p_context_), compared with the high-volatility context. No significant differences between conditions were detected for the drift intercept parameter (_b.drift.intercept.p_context_). The DDM parameters were weakly correlated, except for the noise and drift sensitivity parameters, which showed a strong positive correlation (r > 0.7 for all conditions; Supplementary Figure 1).

WTP ranges
Contrary to our expectations, there was neither a significant effect of context on WTP range (_Rating_context_; Figure 4A, B), nor a significant interaction with later amount (_Rating_contextxev_). Hypothesis H5 was thus not confirmed. There was, however, a group x context interaction (_Rating_groupxcontext_), with a narrower range for the low-volatility context in the group starting with it. Response times for the WTP ranges (i.e., time since the start of the trial until the participant pressed the button to accept the ranges entered), showed a strong and significant main effect of context (_RatingRT_context_; Figure 4C, D), with slower times in the low-volatility context, as well as a group x context interaction (_RatingRT_groupxcontext_), with slower times in the low-volatility context for the group starting with it. 

To further ascertain whether the responses in the second phase were affected by behaviour in the first one, we sought associations between DDM parameters and WTP ranges. Indeed, the noise, and  xxx parameters significantly predicted WTP response times (Supplementary Table 1), whereas yyy predicted the interaction between WTP range and amount significantly (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the effect of context on WTP response times was significantly mediated by the drift intercept, non-decision time and noise parameters (Table 1). These parameters mediated, respectively, the _prop_drift_intercept_%, _prop_nondectime_% and _prop_noise_% of the context effect in WTP response times.

Table 1. Mediation effect of the different drift-diffusion (DDM) parameters on willingness-to-pay (WTP) response time. The table shows estimates of the average mediating effect (ACME) and the proportion of the total effect mediated. The DDM parameters were estimated from the data of the first phase of each context and the WTP parameters from the data of the second phase.
