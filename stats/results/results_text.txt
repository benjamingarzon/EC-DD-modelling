Behavioural measures
As we had hypothesized (H1), there was a significant main effect of context on (log) response times of the first phase (choices), with shorter times for the low-volatility condition (_RT_context_; Figure 2A). The interaction group x context was also significant (_RT_groupxcontext_). Response times showed a dependence on the later amount offered and whether the response was immediate or  (Figure 2B) but the effect of context remained significant even when controlling for these effects (_RTamountchoice_context). There was a main effect of context on choices (_choice_context_; Figure 2C), with a lower probability of choosing the later option in the low volatility context, but the interaction with the later amount offered was not significant (_choice_contextxamount_). Preregistered hypothesis H2 was thus not confirmed, although the effect.  blah blah.

DDM parameters
The DDM parameters showed stability across contexts (Figure 2D; parameter reliabilities are displayed in Table 1). We found an effect of context on non-decision times derived from the DDM fits, with slower times for the low-volatility context, confirming hypothesis H3 (_nondectime.p_context_). Drift sensitivity was significantly higher in the low-volatility context (_b.drift.amount.p_context), thus supporting hypothesis H4. In the low-volatility context, the noise parameter was significantly larger (_noise.p_context_) and the bias smaller (_bias.p_context_), compared with the high-volatility context. No significant differences between conditions were detected for the drift intercept parameter (_b.drift.intercept.p_context_).

WTP ranges
Finally, contrary to our expectation there was no significant effect of context on WTP range (hypothesis H5; Figure 3A).  

As an additional exploratory analysis an in view of this negative finding, to ascertain whether the ratings we sought to find associations between DDM parameters and WTP ranges, to ascertain whether
