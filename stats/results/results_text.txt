Behavioural measures
As the task advanced during its first phase (binary choices), subjects' responses were progressively faster (Figure 2A). In line with hypothesis H1, there was a significant main effect of context on (log) response times, with shorter times for the low-volatility condition (_RT_context_; Figure 2B, C). Note that we compared identical subsets of trials across the low and high-volatility contexts (see Methods). The interaction group x context was also significant (_RT_groupxcontext_). Response times showed a dependence on the later amount offered and whether the response was immediate or delayed, but the effect of context remained significant even when controlling for these effects (_RT_contextCORchoicexamount_). There was a main effect of context on choices (_choice_context_; Figure 2D, E), with a lower probability of choosing the later option in the low-volatility context, but the interaction with the later amount offered was not significant (_choice_contextxamount_), even though its positive sign denoted less choice stochasticity for the low-volatility context, as expected. Thus, in spite of the fact that the context affected response probabilities, preregistered hypothesis H2 was not confirmed.

Drift-Diffusion Model Parameters
Figure 3A shows the DDM parameters across the two contexts. In the low-volatility context, non-decision times were shorter on average after considering the interaction with context presentation order (_nondectime.p_context_; group x context interaction: _nondectime.p_groupxcontext_), confirming hypothesis H3. The drift-sensitivity parameter was significantly higher (_b.drift.amount.p_context_; group x context interaction: _b.drift.amount.p_groupxcontext_), thus supporting hypothesis H4. The noise parameter was also significantly larger (_noise.p_context_; group x context interaction: _noise.p_groupxcontext_) and the bias (marginally) significantly larger (_bias.p_context_, group x context interaction: _bias.p_groupxcontext_) compared with the high-volatility context. No significant differences between conditions were detected for the drift-intercept parameter (_b.drift.intercept.p_context_). Figure 3B shows the average DDM parameter values in the two contexts (after removing the group x context interaction effects). The DDM parameters showed in general low correlations between them, except for the noise and drift-sensitivity parameters, which were strongly and positively correlated as expected (r > 0.7 for all conditions; Supplementary Figure 1).

Willingness-to-Pay Ranges
Contrary to our expectations, there was neither a significant effect of context on WTP range (_Rating_context_; Figure 4A, B), nor a significant interaction with later amount (_Rating_contextxev_), although there was a group x context interaction (_Rating_groupxcontext_), with a narrower range for the low-volatility context in the group starting with this context. Hypothesis H5 was thus not confirmed.  Response times for the WTP ranges (i.e., time since the start of the trial until the participant had set the two sliders to indicate the limits of the WTP range), showed a significant main effect of context (_RatingRT_context_, group x context interaction: _RatingRT_groupxcontext_; Figure 4C, D), with shorter times in the low-volatility context, as well as a group x context interaction (_RatingRT_groupxcontext_). 

To ascertain whether the responses in the second phase were related to the behaviour in the first one, we sought associations between DDM parameters and WTP ranges. Indeed, there was a significant main effect of drift sensitivity on WTP ranges (Supplementary Table 1), as well as interactions between the DDM parameters and the delayed amount on the WTP ranges, with the strongest interaction effects for the drift-sensitivity and noise parameters (i.e., they had the largest absolute t-value; Supplementary Table 2). There were also main effects of the drift-sensitivity and noise parameters on WTP response times (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, the effect of context on WTP response times that we had identified in our previous analyses was significantly mediated by the drift-sensitivity parameter (estimate of the average proportion of the total effect mediated: _prop_drift_sensitivity1_%) when considering the contexts that were presented in the first place. When considering the contexts presented in the second place, the drift-sensitivity (average proportion mediated: _prop_drift_sensitivity2_%) and noise (average proportion mediated: _prop_noise2_%, indicating a full mediation) parameters mediated the context effect on WTP response times. Statistics for these analyses are displayed in Table 1.

Table 1. Mediation effect of the different drift-diffusion (DDM) parameters on willingness-to-pay (WTP) response time. The mediation analyses were performed for the contexts presented in first and second place separately (column context order). The table shows estimates of the average mediating effect (ACME) and the proportion of the total effect mediated. The DDM parameters were estimated from the data of the first phase of each context and the WTP parameters from the data of the second phase.

The DDM parameters were estimated from the data of the first phase of each context and the WTP parameters from the data of the second phase. The associations were estimated separately for the two contexts when presented in first and second order respectively (as indicated by the column 'context order'), and therefore they include all the subjects.
